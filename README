# single- and multi-tenant aad apps

The same app deployed to two app services with two configurations:
- (https://single.identitycrisis.dev) single-tenant - only members of the owning directory can sign-in here
- (https://multi.identitycrisis.dev) multi-tenant - any Azure AD account can sign-in here

Note the workflow differences are limited to a blob of appsettings, which are available in [azure.appSettings.multitenant.json] and [azure.appSettings.singleTenant.json].
